My name is Dima Bykhovsky, and I am a tenured faculty member at [SCE](https://en.sce.ac.il/faculty/bykhovsky) college.
My academic career is focused on advancing sensor signal processing across various applied fields through interdisciplinary research and collaborative projects. I integrate innovative measurement techniques, data acquisition methods, and advanced signal analysis to tackle challenges in areas such as infrared (IR) and gamma spectroscopy, as well as acoustics. My research primarily revolves around developing and refining machine and deep learning algorithms for the precise analysis of sensor data.

A detailed list of my publications is available in my Google scholar [profile](https://scholar.google.co.il/citations?user=CnXQntIAAAAJ) and my brief CV is available via Linkedin [profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dimabykhov).
