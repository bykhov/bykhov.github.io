## Comparison between (free) education resources of Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud Platform, and Microsoft Azure
My goal is to provide students with a free educational resources for a machine learning or deep learning courses. 
To achieve this, I have reviewed the free educational and virtualization resources provided by the three major cloud providers: 
* Amazon Web Services (AWS) 
* Google Cloud Platform (GCP) 
* Microsoft Azure and Microsoft Learn 

### Peface
In order to implement a machine learning or deep learning course, the following resources are required:
1. Programming environment:
   * Jupyter notebooks, Python, and libraries such as TensorFlow, PyTorch, and scikit-learn.
   * GPU-enabled
   * The environment should be easy to set up and use. The most prominent example in Google Colab.

2. Educational materials, such as lectures, tutorials, and hands-on labs:
   * Structured and pedagogically sound.
   * Self-explanatory
   * Up-to-date
   * In different formats, such as text, video, and code.
   * Theoretical, practical, or mixed content.
   * Automatically graded assignments.

The challenge is double: to find a suitable programming environment and to find educational materials.

### Azure and Microsoft Learn
#### Education resources
Microsoft Learn offers numerous free educational resources, such as [TensorFlow fundamentals](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/paths/tensorflow-fundamentals/)
and [PyTorch Fundamentals](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/paths/pytorch-fundamentals/).

Pros:
* Free for **all** users; no need to apply as a student or instructor.
* At least part of the material is pedagogically sound and structured
* Hands-on labs.

Cons:
* From [TensorFlow fundamentals](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/paths/tensorflow-fundamentals/), the following issues were found:
  * Failed to find a free GPU kernel. The resulting training time is quite long, e.g. 1 minute for a single epoch of a simple model. 
  Moreover, sometimes an available kernel is non-existent.
  * Outdated versions, such as TensorFlow 2.2.1 (the current version is 2.16)
  * Inconsistencies within the learning path, like using class-based API in one module and sequential API in another. TensorFlow versions also vary between 2.2 and 2.6.
* From [Understand data science for machine learning](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/paths/understand-machine-learning/):
  * Portions of the code are not working, for example [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/answers/questions/1397264/typeerror-this-plotly-newplot-is-not-a-function-in)
* No direct support for students or instructors. Note, community support is not always helpful (see example in bullet above).
* Trivial badge requirements; user can pass the badge by clicking through the material without any understanding.
* Explanations are text-based (no videos).

#### Virtualization resources
Azure provides a free virtual machine (VM) resource, e.g. [Azure Dev Tools for Teaching](https://azureforeducation.microsoft.com/devtools)
or [Azure for Students](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/students/).

Procs:
* Free \$100 credit for students (confirmed working) with no credit card required.
  * Can be renewed every year.
  * Applied directly by students.
  * Allows for GPU-enabled virtual machines.
* \$200 credit for new users to use Azure services for 30 days. Note, this credit does not support GPU-enabled virtual machines, at least [out of the box](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/data-science-virtual-machine/dsvm-ubuntu-intro?view=azureml-api-2).

Note:
* "Interesting" features require a purchase of Volume Licensing agreement. 

### Google Cloud Platform (GCP)
#### Education resources - Google Cloud Skills Boost credits
* Can to be applied directly by students through [Google Cloud for Students](https://cloud.google.com/edu/students).
  * Didn't tried yet.
* Courses:
  * Can be reviewed through [Google Cloud Skills Boost](https://www.cloudskillsboost.google/).
  * Only labs require special credits.
* For instructors, have to be applied on per course basis through [Google Cloud Career Launchpad Program](https://cloud.google.com/edu/faculty/career-launchpad).
  * Note, the application process may take up to 2 weeks (10 business days).
  * Up to 5,000 credits per course.
  * Applied for the program on 2024-09-19 and still waiting for the response.
* Examples of some relevant courses:
  * [Computer Vision Fundamentals with Google Cloud](https://www.cloudskillsboost.google/course_templates/18) (8 hours, 40 credits)
  * [TensorFlow on Google Cloud](https://www.cloudskillsboost.google/paths/17/course_templates/12) (15 hours, 25 credits)
that is a part of the [Machine Learning Engineer Learning Path](https://www.cloudskillsboost.google/paths/17)

#### Virtualization resources
Pros:
* \$300 credit for new users valid for 90 days. Note, this credit does not support GPU-enabled virtual machines.
* \$100 in Google Cloud credits per teaching staff and up to \$50 in Cloud credits per student through [Google Cloud for Faculty](https://cloud.google.com/edu/faculty) with no credit card required.


### Amazon Web Services (AWS)
#### [AWS Academy](https://aws.amazon.com/training/awsacademy/)
* Dedicated to educational institutions.
* Provides free resources for educators and students.
* The process of registration requires Central Point of Contact (CPOC) from the institution. 
The CPOC appointment involves obligatory training and requires an institutional license agreement (non-trivial bureaucracy).
  * Without CPOC, it is impossible to assess the resources. Even detailed syllabi are unavailable.

Procs:
* Courses are carefully structed and organized.
* Self-explanatory
* Videos-based explanations.
* PPT presentation are avialable for teaching in class.

Cons:
* The material is mostly technical and less approproate for academical teaching.

#### [AWS Educate](https://www.awseducate.com/)
* Limited number of basic resources.
* Appears less useful for academic purposes (replaced by AWS Academy).

#### Virtualization resources
* All users can apply for AWS Free Tier, which includes 750 hours of EC2 instances per month for 12 months.
* Certified institutions with CPOC can apply for \$50 in AWS credits per student. 


### Summary of academic resources comparison
#### Education resources

| Topic                       |   Azure    |      AWS      |        GCP        |

| Management                  | Individual | Institutional |  Course faculty   |
| Bureaucracy                 |     No     |    Yes    |      Minimal      |
| Pre-review                 |     ★★★     |     ★[^1]     |     ★★    |
| Quality/organization      |     ★      |     ★★★     |        ★★        |
| Academic level          |     ★★★     |      ★      |       ★★?[^2]       |
| ML Theory vs MLOps Practice |    Both    |     MLOps     |       Both        |
| Self-explanatory | ★★ | ★★ | ★★★ |


[^1]: AWS Academy resources are not assessable without CPOC.

[^2]: Some GCP resources are not assessable without approval. Still waiting for the response. Hopefully, to be updated soon.

#### Virtualization resources
* The free resources are sufficient for hundreds of hours of GPU-enabled virtual machine with per hour billing.
* Setting up the Linux virtual machine with GPU and Python/Jupyter environment in non-trivial. 
Either selecting the right Docker image or installing the required libraries manually
requires additional training and time.
