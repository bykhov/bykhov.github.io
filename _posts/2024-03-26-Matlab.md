I am a proud Matlab user since my first DSP course in 1997. Despite transitioning to Python in recent years, I believe Matlab still has an unparalleled plot system and excellent signal processing support. 

Recent dramatic news regarding version 2024a:
* Support of local functions in any place of a script.
* Spell checker

Community contributions to Matlab tend to be individual efforts rather than coordinated projects. However, there are still some community-maintained features that enhance the graphical interface:
* While Matplotlib automatically aligns labels, Matlab requires a community [solution](https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/49542-phymhan-matlab-axis-label-alignment) for this task. It also has some interesting [discussion](https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/49542-phymhan-matlab-axis-label-alignment?tab=discussions#discussions_2457275) posts. Nevertheless, it has not been maintained since 2016 (but still functions!). 
* A useful Sankey flowchart implementation [here](https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/101516-sankey-flow-chart) and [here](https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/128679-sankey-plot) (the latter is more recent).
