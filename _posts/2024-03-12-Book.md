For a few years, I have been teaching introductory random processes [course](/teaching/rp/). 
I have found, that ["Intuitive Probability and Random Processes using MATLABÂ®"](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/b104645) by [Steven Kay](https://www.ele.uri.edu/faculty/kay.html) published in 2006 is an exceptional resource. While Kay's "Fundamentals of Statistical Signal Processing" consists of three volumes packed with advanced mathematical theory, his more recent work combines practical engineering approaches with simulations that are appropriate for undergraduate students.


Nevertheless, I recently came across a remarkable new book titled ["Introduction to Probability for Data Science"](https://probability4datascience.com/) by [Stanley H. Chan](https://engineering.purdue.edu/ChanGroup/stanleychan.html), available for *free* through the ["Free ECE Textbook Initiative."](https://fet.engin.umich.edu/) I was pleasantly surprised by its modern design and the inclusion of both theory and code. It also aligns with an ECE background and supports both Matlab and Python. The supplementary [homepage](https://probability4datascience.com/) is also highly recommended.

I suggest that for the next edition of this book, the author could enhance the Exercise sections by including previous homework and exams as questions.
