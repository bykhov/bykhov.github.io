Coursera has opened for free an excellent course **Understanding Research** ([link](https://www.coursera.org/learn/medical-research)). Since the course examples are from the field of medicine, the full name is *Understanding Medical Research: Your Facebook Friend is Wrong*. Do not bother about the name.
While most of the examples in the course are related to evidence‐based medicine, they are also relevant to any statistical-based research. The lecturer of the course is a Yale professor of medicine with 10k+ citations ([Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=iB9er1AAAAAJ&hl=en)).

I believe this course is **obligatory** for every post-graduate student as an orientation course.

My rating: ★★★★★
