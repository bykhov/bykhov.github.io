There are several Python packages for time series analysis. The list below is not exhaustive, and the packages are not mutually exclusive. 

 Feature extraction:
* [tsfresh](https://tsfresh.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) - Feature extraction from time series
* [tsfel](https://tsfel.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) - Feature extraction from time series
* [catch22](https://time-series-features.gitbook.io/catch22) - A Python package for time series characterization and feature extraction
* [hctsa](https://github.com/benfulcher/hctsa) - Highly Comparative Time-Series Analysis (HCTSA) feature extraction package (Matlab)
* [tsfeatures](https://github.com/Nixtla/tsfeatures) - Time series feature extraction (Python implementation of the R package).
Additional documentation is available from the original [R package](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tsfeatures/vignettes/tsfeatures.html)
