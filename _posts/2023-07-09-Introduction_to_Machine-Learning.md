Coursera has opened for free till end of 2023 a course **Introduction to Machine Learning** ([link](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning-duke?utm_medium=coursera&utm_source=promo))

My rating: ★★★

Brief notes:
* The course has a nice and concise presentation of applicative **deep learning** theory. It is not "machine learning" stated in the course name.
* 5+ years old course based on Tensorflow v1, that is obsolete. Anyway, no graded coding excises are required to finish the course (only ungraded coding examples).
* Much weaker than [deeplearning.ai](https://www.deeplearning.ai/ offerings).
* Took me 10 minutes to get a [certificate](https://coursera.org/share/df3a887cd391ed48deb21429e798655e).
