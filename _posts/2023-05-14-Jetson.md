## Jetson Nano Experience
* I want to debrief my experience with the Jetson Nano card as a part of the Nvidia [certification program](https://developer.nvidia.com/embedded/learn/jetson-ai-certification-programs)
* It follows the [Getting Started with AI on Jetson Nano](https://courses.nvidia.com/courses/course-v1:DLI+S-RX-02+V2/) course by Nvidia.

### Configuration
* Configuration of a card is non-trivial if you want something beyond basic configuration or a standard Docker container. 
* Some things require timely compilation from scratch. I found myself too used to everything pre-compiled in the Windows environment.
* I have unsuccessfully tried configuring a Linux host for Jetson on my Windows machine by WSL2. The particular challenge was the USB [configuration](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/connect-usb) for communication with Jetson.
* Creating custom Docker containers is an important skill. The building scripts for all important containers are provided. There is a nice free MOOC course [DevOps with Docker](https://devopswithdocker.com/) that I have started. However, my current responsibilities prevented me from delving deeply into the subject.

### [Dependency hell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_hell)
*   There are too many ways to install the same package (I have also tried Miniconda [installation](https://medium.com/@seehleung/how-to-setup-a-jetson-nano-for-ai-projects-in-2021-f8d0ac557966) for Jetson), not including the option for multiple environments:
    ```bash
    pip install matplotlib
    sudo pip install matplotlib
    sudo apt install python3-matplotlib
    conda install matplotlib
    ```
	I have tried to be consistent with `sudo pip install`

* Sometimes `pip` option `--ignore-installed` may help with some errors.
* Sometimes `pip` option `--no-dependencies` may help to prevent overwriting the pre-installed OpenCV.
* Symbolic links may be required.
* Edit path in `~/.bashrc` may be required.

### Camera
* There are at least two main interfaces for the camera: [GStreamer](https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/) and OpenCV. I have used OpenCV for its simpler interface. Nevertheless, the usage of real-time video requires GStreamer.

### Tensorflow
I prefer Tensorflow for its simplicity. Some points to note are:
* Theoretically, up to version 2.7.0 is supported - I have succeeded only 2.6.2, which is also nice.
* Some sub-package was too challenging to install: e.g. `addons, tesnorflow_io`. 
* Succeed with `tensorflow-hub` with some tweaks - it is probably the most useful part for out-of-the-box applications.
* Speed-up by TensorRT is required.  I have even taken a free project on Coursera ([certificate](https://coursera.org/share/678fc097e9f7fb2e99b11a569bb6cb08), my dedicated [review](https://bykhov.github.io/posts/tensorrt_course/)) and somewhat inspected a similar [course](https://courses.nvidia.com/courses/course-v1:DLI+L-FX-18+V2/course/) by Nvidia (that was free for me as an academic ambassador). Still waiting to apply, it can be an important subject to present to students in the future, not just in the Jetson Nano context.

### Copy files from Windows host
To copy files by SSH from Windows host ([ref](https://www.addictivetips.com/ubuntu-linux-tips/transfer-files-to-linux-from-windows-10-over-ssh/)): 
* `scp` command:
`scp Filepathinwindows username@ubuntuserverip:linuxserverpath`
	
	Example: `scp .\test.txt nano@192.168.55.1:~/`
* [WinSCP](https://winscp.net/)

### IDE
* The card does not support serious IDE due to memory and CPU limitations.
* Jupyter Notebook and Jupyter Lab worked fine with some essential modern extensions, such as variable inspection.  However, I have encountered some problems with images inside Jupyter.
* Remote SSL is fantastic. While not so convenient for image presentation, it has all the advantages of a modern IDE.

### LEDs
Nice and convenient. I still need clarification on whether a current-limiting resistor of $$220 \Omega$$ is obligatory, since LED light is almost invisible.

### Repository
Overall, the [repository]( https://github.com/bykhov/jetson) provides an overview of my experiments using the Jetson Nano for various tasks, including camera integration, face detection, and person-presence detection.

### Summary (beyond Jetson)
* Learned some Linux (Ubuntu)
* Learned working with remote Python (ssh, Jupyter) in IDE
* Introduction to Docker
* Introduction to TensorRT
