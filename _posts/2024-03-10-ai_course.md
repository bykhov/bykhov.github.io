Recently, the implementation (inference) of the pre-trained models has become incredibly effortless. [deeplearning.ai](https://www.deeplearning.ai/) has proposed a new free [course](https://www.deeplearning.ai/short-courses/open-source-models-hugging-face/) that utilizes open-source models from [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/) for the different applications of NLP, audio signals processing and computer vision.

The course is designed for a completely hands-on experience, free of theoretical concepts. Nevertheless, is short, concise, effective and practical.

My rating: ★★★★★
