There are dozens of books on deep learning (DL) that were published in recent years. I want to particurlally outline the 
"Understanding Deep Learning" book
by [Simon J.D. Prince](https://www.linkedin.com/in/simon-prince-615bb9165/). This book has comprehensive [homepage](https://udlbook.github.io/udlbook/) that offers the book as a free download, along with supplementary code, presentations, and more.
Written with clear and concise mathematical notation, the book is further enhanced by numerous illustrative color figures.  Regular updates and blog posts ensure the content remains timely and accurate.
