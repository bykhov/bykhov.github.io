### Short debriefing of the [MLE Conference](https://en.sce.ac.il/news/mle_2023_conference)

Some positive points:
* Logo permission from IEEE Israel (thanks to Shmuel Auster)
* Nice refreshments (special thanks to Victor Kagalovsky and Regina Vaisman)
* Excellent visiting lecturers and great student engagement in these lectures
* Timely website updates (thanks to Shay Shabtay) 

What we should have done better:
* Actively promoting of [Sensor special issue](https://www.mdpi.com/journal/sensors/special_issues/E7RBRQ027K)
* Conference plan booklet
* Ashdod campus involvement
* Pitch lectures (1-2 minutes) for poster presenters

Next time nice to have:
* Rollup at the entrance
* Name tags
* More students
* Demos
* More in-house PR (both campuses)
