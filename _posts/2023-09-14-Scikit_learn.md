*Scikit*-learn developers propose the **free** course on *scikit*, titled ["Machine learning in Python with scikit-learn"](https://www.fun-mooc.fr/en/courses/machine-learning-python-scikit-learn/). The course [repository](https://github.com/INRIA/scikit-learn-mooc) is also available, but it does not show the correct answers for quizzes.

Enrollment: from Sep 18, 2023 

Course starts: from Nov 08, 2023

Proc:
* Sufficient length
* Surprisingly, some depth
* Enormous number of exercises

Note:
* Heavily pandas-oriented and, therefore, heavily social sciences-oriented. This fact makes it less attractive for engineering students and practitioners who have their data mostly in numerical and matrix form.

Precaution:
* The (realistic) estimated time commitment for the full course is **30-40 hours** (or more).

My rating: ★★★★★
