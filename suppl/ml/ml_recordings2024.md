Recommended supplementary videos for meetings 1, 2, 3 (but not **4**(!) that is covered by a different resource):
* [Supervised Machine Learning: Regression and Classification](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning) 
by Andrew Ng is one of the most popular courses on machine learning. 
You don't need to complete the course, but it is recommended to watch the videos in "audit" (**free**) mode.
Another option is to watch the [videos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLkDaE6sCZn6FNC6YRfRQc_FbeQrF8BwGI) on YouTube.
