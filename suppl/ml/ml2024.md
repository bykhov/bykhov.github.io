### MOOC certificates
A certificate of completion of the following online courses (MOOC) is required for the course completion:
* Kaggle learn [Python](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/python) - 6% of the final grade
* Kaggle learn [Pandas](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/pandas) - 6% of the final grade
* Kaggle learn [Intro to Machine Learning](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/intro-to-machine-learning) - 6% of the final grade
* Machine learning in Python with scikit-learn [course](https://www.fun-mooc.fr/en/courses/machine-learning-python-scikit-learn/) - 6% for each of the 7 modules, 42% of the final grade. 
    * Grade sheet **or** certificate is required (certification may take some time).
    * Note, this course requires a significant time investment.

### Hackathon competition
Hackathon competition is a part of the course:
The competition is held on the last week of the course, 21/08/2024 13:00 till 22/08/2024 (closing time to be announced).
* The competition is held in the form of a Kaggle competition.
* The competition grade depends on the participant's position in the competition leaderboard.
* The detailed description of the competition and its grading is scheduled to the lecture a week before the competition (14/08/2024).
* The special bonuses for the top participants:
  * Special certificates
  * Vouchers for two of online Nvidia courses, valued $90 each:
    * [Accelerating End-to-End Data Science Workflows](https://courses.nvidia.com/courses/course-v1:DLI+S-DS-01+V1/)
    * [Fundamentals of Accelerated Computing with CUDA Python](https://courses.nvidia.com/courses/course-v1:DLI+C-AC-02+V1/)
  * Up to 3% bonus to the final grade
[](The special prize committee may decide to recommend either of top participants to extend the competition submission as an engineering project and/or a scientific paper)
