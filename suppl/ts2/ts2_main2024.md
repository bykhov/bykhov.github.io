## Signal Prediction and Classification (SPC) course, 2024
Welcome to the Signal Prediction and Classification (SPC) course! This page concentrates on course information and materials. For communication and submissions, please refer to the complimentary [Moodle page](https://moodle.sce.ac.il/course/view.php?id=29198).

### Course Overview
This course integrates data-driven machine learning (ML) with principles of digital signal processing (DSP) and random processes, primarily through the least squares (LS) method.

#### Course objectives:

By the end of this course, students will be able to:
* Evaluate signal characteristics including amplitude, frequency, and phase.
* Analyze signals using auto-correlation and partial auto-correlation functions.
* Utilize AR, MA, and ARMA models for signal prediction (regression).
* Apply ARMA models to multivariate exogenous and endogenous signals.
* Compare and select appropriate performance metrics.
* Classify signals using logistic regression and feature engineering techniques.

#### Special Notes:
* This is a newly developed course tailored to be self-contained, with no formal prerequisite courses required. However, a basic understanding of probability and linear algebra is assumed.
* The course emphasizes hands-on learning, with assignments conducted using Python.


### Grading Policy
The course grade consists of homework assignments (100%).

#### Homework
* Coding assignments in Matlab.
* Submission via the Moodle page.
* The homeworks are graded based on the following criteria:
    * Solution correctness (25%)
    * Code quality (25%)
    * Explanation clarity (25%)
    * Formatting (25%): special attention is required for the following:
        * Plots are required to be labeled and have a title
        * Headings for each section
* Submissions should include a LiveScript notebook and corresponding PDF file.
