## Advances Signal Processing course, 2024

* This is the main page for the graduate course on Advanced Signal Processing (Time-Series Analysis), 2024.
* This page is used for course information and materials.
* The complimentary Moodle page is used for course communication and submissions.

### Course information

* The course is designed to provide data-driven machine learning (ML) interpretation of the digital signal processing (DSP)
  and random processes.

#### Course objectives:

To provide a capability:

* Evaluate signal amplitude, frequency, and phase.
* Analyze signals by using auto-correlation and partial auto-correlation functions.
* Use AR, MA, and ARMA models for signal prediction (regression).
* Use ARMA models for multivariate exogenous and endogenous signals.
* Select between different performance metrics.
* Classify signals by using logistic regression and feature engineering.

#### Special notes:

* This is a new course that is under development.
* The course is designed to be self-contained (i.e., no formal prerequisite courses are required), although the basic knowledge of probability and linear algebra is assumed.
* The course is designed to be hands-on, and the students are expected to use Python or Matlab for the course assignments.

### Grading

* The course grade is based on homework assignments with the following components:
  * Assignments - all but one are mandatory (80%)
  * Presentation of the assignments in the class - at least two presentations are mandatory (20%)
  * Participation bonus is based on the student's participation in the class, i.e.,
    asking questions, answering questions, and participating in the class discussions (20%)

#### Homework presentation

* The homework concept is: "Prepare solutions and present your answers to your peers."
* Presentations are randomly assigned to the students.
* The presentation steps are:
  * The student presents the problem to the class.
  * The student presents the solution guidelines.
  * The student presents the Python or Matlab code to solve the problem.

### Meeting Schedule

* The course meets once a week for 90 minutes each.
* Note, the course topics are **subject to change**, since is the first time the course is given.
