## [Signal Prediction and Classification Course, 2024](/suppl/ts2/ts2_main2024)

### Course Overview
This course integrates data-driven machine learning (ML) with principles of digital signal processing (DSP) and random processes, primarily through the least squares (LS) method.

#### Course objectives:

By the end of this course, students will be able to:
* Evaluate signal characteristics including amplitude, frequency, and phase.
* Analyze signals using auto-correlation and partial auto-correlation functions.
* Utilize AR, MA, and ARMA models for signal prediction (regression).
* Apply ARMA models to multivariate exogenous and endogenous signals.
* Compare and select appropriate performance metrics.
* Classify signals using logistic regression and feature engineering techniques.

#### Special Notes:
* This is a newly developed course tailored to be self-contained, with no formal prerequisite courses required. However, a basic understanding of probability and linear algebra is assumed.
* The course emphasizes hands-on learning, with assignments conducted using Python.


### Grading Policy
The course grade consists of homework assignments (100%).

#### Homework
* Coding assignments in Matlab.
* Submission via the Moodle page.
* The homeworks are graded based on the following criteria:
    * Solution correctness (25%)
    * Code quality (25%)
    * Explanation clarity (25%)
    * Formatting (25%): special attention is required for the following:
        * Plots are required to be labeled and have a title
        * Headings for each section
* Submissions should include a LiveScript notebook and corresponding PDF file.
