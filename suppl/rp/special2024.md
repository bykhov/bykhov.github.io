### Special Assessment for Reservists - [Random Processes Course](/teaching/rp/)
The goal is to describe the course requirements and the special assessment for reservists.

The assessment is based on the following components:
* MOOCs courses (Matlab) - 60%
* Simulation assignment - 40%

Submission of MOOC certificates and the simulation assignment 
is through the Moodle homepage of the course.

#### MOOCs courses (Matlab)
* Signal Processing Onramp - [link](https://matlabacademy.mathworks.com/details/signal-processing-onramp/signalprocessing) -  10%
* Signal Processing with MATLAB - [link](https://matlabacademy.mathworks.com/details/signal-processing-with-matlab/mlsg) - 46%
* Statistics Onramp - [link](https://matlabacademy.mathworks.com/details/statistics-onramp/orst) - 4%

#### Simulation assignment
* Simulation assignment 12.3 from the [Lecture Notes](/rp/RP_Book.pdf).
* The assignment should be submitted in a single LiveScript file, including the code, results, and optional Word file with additional explanations.
* The code should be well documented and include comments.
* The results should be clearly explained and organized, either in English inside the LiveScript or in Hebrew in the Word file.
