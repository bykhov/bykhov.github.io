### [Random Processes Course](/teaching/rp/) - Special Assessment for Reservists - 2025
The goal of this page is to describe the course requirements and the special assessment for reservists.

The assessment is based on the following components:
* MOOCs courses (Matlab) - 30% (instead of 15% for the regular students)
* Simulation assignment - 70% (10% for each of the 7 sub-questions)

Submission of MOOC certificates and the simulation assignment 
is through the Moodle homepage of the course.


#### Simulation assignment
* Simulation assignment 11.4 from the [Lecture Notes](/rp/RP_Book.pdf).
* Usage of the published [examples](/suppl/rp/code/) is encouraged.
* The code should be submitted in a single LiveScript file, including the code and results.
* The code should be well documented and include comments.
* The results should presented in a clear and organized manner, either in English within the LiveScript or in Hebrew within the Word file.
