### Summary and presentation guidelines
##### Selection guidelines
* A recent topic (2020-tomorrow) in the field of AI, ML, or DL.
* Breakthroughs in the field, typically with ethical implications.
* Life-changing solutions or technologies.
* I am aware that the topics are not trivial. Nevertheless, the goal is to broaden the horizons and to understand the implications of the AI/ML/DL technologies.

##### Examples of the presentation topics
Examples of the presentation topics:
* Why self-driving cars are not yet on the roads, being promised for years?
* DL-based resume screening: how it works and why it is not always fair?
* Responsibility of AI: who is responsible for the AI decisions?
  * For example, Tesla's autopilot accidents 
* What are the implications of autonomous weapons?
  * Note to emphasize the difference between rule-based and DL-based weapons systems
  * Sea drone [example](https://spectrum.ieee.org/sea-drone)
* Adversarial attacks on AI: how they work and how to protect against them?
* AI in the courtroom and parole decisions: how AI is used in the legal system?
* Law of Accelerating Returns (Kurzweil 2001) and singularity: is it real?
* Robotics: Foundational models, e.g. [Open-X](https://robotics-transformer-x.github.io/)
* Code autocompletion tools productivity, e.g. [Copilot](https://github.blog/news-insights/research/research-quantifying-github-copilots-impact-on-developer-productivity-and-happiness/) 
* [AlphaFold](https://deepmind.google/technologies/alphafold/): how it works and what are the implications for the drug discovery?

Other topics are possible, but **please consult with the lecturer** before starting the work.
