## Jetson Nano
The goal of the project is to show a proficiency in using of Jeston for some basic or intermediate level application. Useful links:
* Kit [description](https://developer.nvidia.com/embedded/jetson-nano-developer-kit)
* Certification program [Project-Based Assessment](https://developer.nvidia.com/embedded/learn/jetson-ai-certification-programs#submit_project)
* Project [examples](https://developer.nvidia.com/embedded/community/jetson-projects)
* (optional free 2-hour course) [Optimize TensorFlow Models For Deployment with TensorRT](https://www.coursera.org/projects/tensorflow-tensorrt) at Coursera.
Note to replace `Install TensorFlow-GPU 2.0 and TensorRT Runtime:` section in Colab with the following. It may take some time to run.

```python
%%bash  
sudo apt install python3-libnvinfer
python3 -m pip install --upgrade tensorrt  
```
