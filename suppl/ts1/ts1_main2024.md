## Selected Topics on Machine and Deep Learning (STMDL), 2024

* This page is used for course information and materials.
* The complimentary [Moodle page](https://moodle.sce.ac.il/course/view.php?id=29196) is used for course communication and submissions.
* 

### Course information

* The goal of the course is to provide a basic understanding of the machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) concepts.

#### Course objectives:

To provide a capability:
* Python programming for ML and DL.
* Conceptual understanding of:
  * Data
  * Models
  * Loss functions
  * Metrics
* Model training and evaluation.

This course is expected to have a _follow-up_ course on signals prediction and classification.

#### Special notes:

* This is a new course that is under development.
* The course is designed to be self-contained (i.e., no formal prerequisite courses are required), although the basic knowledge of probability and linear algebra is assumed.
* The students are expected to use Python for the course assignments.

### Grading policy

The course grade is based on homework assignments (100%)

### Meetings
* Each meeting is 3 hours long. 
* Note, the course topics are **subject to change**, since is the first time the course is given.
* This is the tentative course schedule:
