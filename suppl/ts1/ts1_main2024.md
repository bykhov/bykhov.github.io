## Selected Topics on Machine and Deep Learning (STMDL), 2024

* This page is used for course information and materials.
* The complimentary [Moodle page](https://moodle.sce.ac.il/course/view.php?id=29196) is used for course communication and submissions.
* 

### Course information

* The goal of the course is to provide a basic understanding of the machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) concepts.

#### Course objectives:

To provide a capability:
* Python programming for ML and DL.
* Conceptual understanding of:
  * Data
  * Models
  * Loss functions
  * Metrics
* Model training and evaluation.

This course is expected to have a _follow-up_ course on signals prediction and classification.

#### Special notes:

* This is a new course that is under development.
* The course is designed to be self-contained (i.e., no formal prerequisite courses are required), although the basic knowledge of probability and linear algebra is assumed.
* The students are expected to use Python for the course assignments.

### Grading policy

The course grade is based on homework assignments with the following components:
* MOOC certificates (50%), 5 certificates 10% each
* Presentation (25%)
* Homework (25%)
* Participation bonus is based on the student's participation in the class, i.e.,
  asking questions, answering questions, and participating in the class discussions (up to 10%)

### MOOC certificates
A certificate of completion of the following online courses (MOOC) is required for the course completion:
* Kaggle learn [Python](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/python)
* Kaggle learn [Pandas](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/pandas)
* Kaggle learn [Intro to Machine Learning](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/intro-to-machine-learning)
* Kaggle learn [Intermediate Machine Learning](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/intermediate-machine-learning)
* Kaggle learn [Feature Engineering](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/feature-engineering)
* Kaggle learn [Time Series](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/time-series)

### Presentation
Each student is required to present a python package or a library that are used for machine learning or deep learning of signals:
* The presentation is scheduled for the last week of the course.
* General requirements:
  * The presentation is done solo.
  * The presentation is 30 minutes long.
  * The presentation is graded based on the content and the presentation skills.
* The presentation includes:
  * Briefly introduce the package and its purpose. Explain why itâ€™s relevant and how it can benefit developers.
  * Explain the package/library philosophy.
  * Explain the package/library special capabilities and features.
  * Hands-on example - a Jupyter notebook with a practical example of the package/library usage.
* The supplementary materials to be submitted in advance of the presentation include:
  * Presentation slides
  * Summary - 2 pages, with emphasis on:
    * The package/library philosophy
    * The package/library special capabilities
  * Hands-on example - a Jupyter notebook with a simple example of the package/library usage.
* Package/library list:
  * Recommended packages - feature extraction:

  * Any other package/library can be proposed for the instructor approval.

### Meetings
* Each meeting is 3 hours long. 
* Note, the course topics are **subject to change**, since is the first time the course is given.
* This is the tentative course schedule:
