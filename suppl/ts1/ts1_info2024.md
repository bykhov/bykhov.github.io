### Course information

* The goal of the course is to provide a basic understanding of the machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) concepts.

#### Course objectives:

To provide a capability:
* Python programming for ML and DL.
* Conceptual understanding of:
    * Data
    * Models
    * Loss functions
    * Metrics
* Model training and evaluation.

This course is expected to have a _follow-up_ course on signals prediction and classification.

### Grading policy
The course grade is based on homework assignments (100%)

#### Homework
* Coding assignments in Matlab.
* Submission via the Moodle page.
* The homeworks are graded based on the following criteria:
    * Solution correctness (25%)
    * Code quality (25%)
    * Explanation clarity (25%)
    * Formatting (25%): special attention is required for the following:
        * Plots are required to be labeled and have a title
        * Headings for each section
* Submissions should include a LiveScript notebook and corresponding PDF file.

#### Special notes:

* This is a new course that is under development.
* The course is designed to be self-contained (i.e., no formal prerequisite courses are required), although the basic knowledge of probability and linear algebra is assumed.
* The students are expected to use Matlab LiveScript for the course assignments. Matlab version 2024a is recommended.
