#### Sensor signal processing
Over the years, I have been involved in several projects related to sensor signal processing. 

##### Uni-dimensional sensors
* Gamma-ray spectroscopy: compensation of hardware limitations with sophisticated signal processing
* Infra-red spectroscopy: medical applications
* Current sensors: cyber-security applications
* Photodetectors: cyber-security and optical communication 
* Software-defined radios: cyber-security and communication

##### Imaging sensors
* Thermal imaging: medical applications
* Ultrasound imaging: medical applications
* Hyperspectral imaging: remote sensing
