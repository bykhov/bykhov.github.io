#### Sensor signal processing
My research in sensor signal processing covers a variety of interdisciplinary projects, integrating innovative approaches to measurement, data acquisition, and advanced signal analysis techniques.
The projects are often interdisciplinary and involve collaboration with researchers from different fields, including physics, engineering, computer science, and medicine.

* Many of these projects involve:
  * Designing experimental measurements, including analyzing the parameters and limitations of measurement systems.
  * Data acquisition implementation that involves the end-to-end integration of sensor signal acquisition with the suitable  ADCs or digitizers.
  * Signal processing that ranges from traditional digital and statistical methods to advanced machine learning and deep learning techniques.
  * Post-processing, visualization, and result analysis.


##### Measurement sensors
* Gamma-ray spectroscopy: compensation of hardware limitations with sophisticated signal processing methods
* Infra-red spectroscopy: medical applications
* Acoustic sensors: fluid mechanics
* Current sensors: cyber-security applications
* Photodetectors: cyber-security and optical communication

##### Communication sensors
* Software-defined radios: cyber-security and communication channel modeling

##### Imaging sensors
