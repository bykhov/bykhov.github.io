**General topic**: Deep neural networks (DNNs) based methods for nuclear spectroscopy. 

**Preface**: Detectors create an electrical pulse for each particle that arrives at the detector at random times. Therefore, the produced electrical pulses will overlap if the activity is high. In the literature, this occurrence is known as the _pile-up_ effect. It can significantly distort the analysis of a particular radioactive source.

**Goal**: Estimating intensity and the distribution of the energies (termed pile-up correction) from a detector output signal.

This research is a collaboration between scientists from SCE, BGU, and the Chinese Academy of Sciences.
