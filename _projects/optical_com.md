I conducted extensive research on different aspects of optical wireless communication during my PhD studies and until a few years ago:
* Short-range diffuse communication for a wireless optical bus
* Remote optics-based metrology
	- Methods
	- Optical devices
* In-door communication:
	- Resource allocation
	- Multi-user OFDM 
	- Channel characterization (coherence time and distance)
* Short-range communication in turbulent media (server backplane)
	- Experimental characterization
	- Cross-talk analysis
* Mid-range communication in turbulent media
	- Channel simulation by stochastic differential equations (SDEs)
* Communication performance
