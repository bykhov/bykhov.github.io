It also aligns with an ECE background and supports both Matlab and Python. The supplementary <a href="https://probability4datascience.com/">homepage</a> is also highly recommended. It’s also important to note the introductory material related to machine learning and data science, as it can be beneficial for follow-up courses.</p> <p>I suggest that for the next edition of this book, the author could enhance the Exercise sections by his including previous homework and exams as questions.</p> <p><sub><sup> LinkedIn <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/introduction-probability-data-science-stanley-h-chan-dima-bykhovsky-cdbwe/">repost</a> </sup></sub></p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="books"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[For a few years, I have been teaching an introductory random processes course.
