Nevertheless, less recommended.</li> <li><strong>Intro to Deep Learning</strong>: excellent hands-on illustration of neural-network concept.</li> <li><strong>Computer Vision</strong>: less appreciated by students. In my opinion, this course tries to combine too many things altogether. It can be considered a guided classwork example rather than self-study homework.</li> </ul>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="Kaggle"/><category term="MOOC"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Usage of short MOOC courses for ML/DL education I am using free MOOC courses in my teaching, while each certificate is considered binary-graded homework.
