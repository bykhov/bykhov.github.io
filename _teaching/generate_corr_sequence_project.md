The following project is proposed:

### Continue [`generate_corr_sequence`](https://github.com/bykhov/generate_corr_sequence) package development
* **General goal:** [`generate_corr_sequence`](https://github.com/bykhov/generate_corr_sequence) package improvement
* **Main goal:** implement the paper [Exact ARMA lattice predictors from autocorrelation functions](https://doi.org/10.1109/78.285651)
* **Ideal outcome:** the new function in [`statsmodels`](https://www.statsmodels.org/stable/index.html) package that is inverse of [`statsmodels.tsa.arima_process.arma_acf`](https://www.statsmodels.org/dev/generated/statsmodels.tsa.arima_process.arma_acf.html) function, based on the above-mentioned paper.
* **Areas**: digital signal processing, random processes, Python
