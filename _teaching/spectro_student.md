The field of spectroscopy deals with analyzing the rate of arrival and energy of particles. One of the most popular methods in this field is using signal processing techniques to enhance the accuracy of the analysis results.

Our team, comprising Dr. Tom Trigano from SCE and Prof. [Itzhak Orion](https://in.bgu.ac.il/engn/nuclear/pages/staff/Itzhak%20Orion.aspx) from BGU and me, is seeking a prospective M.Sc. or Ph.D. candidate from the Departments of Electro-optics, Energy, or Nuclear Engineering. The other probably possible option is to start the research as a funded SCE M.Sc. student (5,600NIS/month + teaching) and to (optionally) continue with this topic as a Ph.D. student in one of these departments.

The goal of the thesis is to utilize signal processing methods, with a focus on deep learning, to analyze the output signal of a spectrometric sensor.
