##### Integration projects (Sensors, IoT, and Cloud)

* Running ML/DL algorithms on low-cost, low-power and low-resource hardware, e.g. [Raspberry Pi](https://ai.google.dev/edge/litert/microcontrollers/python) and [STM32](https://www.st.com/content/dam/AME/2020/sensors-embedded-tech-ve-2020/mdg-demo/STM32CubeAI_product_overview.pdf), [TensorFlow Lite for Microcontrollers](https://www.tensorflow.org/lite/microcontrollers) and [Edge Impulse](https://www.edgeimpulse.com/).
  * Open to suggestions for specific projects.

* Running IoT sensors with cloud analytics, e.g. using a physical device that sends data to [AWS IoT](https://aws.amazon.com/iot/), [Azure IoT](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/solutions/iot) or [Google IoT](https://cloud.google.com/architecture/connected-devices/iot-platform-product-architecture).
  * Open to suggestions for specific projects.

* Configure and deploy virtual machines with GPU configuration and Jupiter notebook on AWS, Azure or Google Cloud platforms for teaching ML/DL (see also [here](/blog/2024/virtual/)).

##### Research projects (Signal processing, machine learning and sensors)
The following projects are mostly recommended for students who are interested in continuing toward an M.Sc. studies (thesis track).

* Galvanic skin response (GSR) analysis (co-supervised with Dr. [Nir Trabelsi](https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=2807768889257381&id=145856082115355&set=a.145856878781942) from Mechanical Engineering Department). 
  * An example of a GSR equipment is [Shimmer3 GSR](https://shimmersensing.com/product/shimmer3-gsr-unit/)
  * GSR equipment is commonly used to measure the electrical conductance of the skin, which changes with sweat gland activity, often used in stress detection, emotional response research, and more.

* Water flow analysis in pipes, co-supervised with Dr. [Lev Nelik](https://www.pumpsandsystems.com/author/lev-nelik) from Civil Engineering Department. 
  * Dr. Nelik is known for his expertise in pump systems and fluid mechanics
  * The goal of the project is to develop a system that can analyze water flow in pipes using sensors and machine learning algorithms.

* Droplet analysis - the follow-up project of the [ML course competition](https://www.kaggle.com/t/6969e148f04c49de9a54b7c0f16cf8cd),  co-supervised with Dr. [Merav Arogeti](https://en.sce.ac.il/faculty/merav_arogeti) from Mechanical Engineering Department.
  * The goal of the project is to develop a system that can analyze droplets using acoustic microphone, underwater microphone and ultrafast camera.
