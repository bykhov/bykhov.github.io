##### Integration projects (Sensors, IoT, and Cloud)

* (open to suggestions) Running ML/DL algorithms on low-cost, low-power and low-resource hardware, e.g. [Raspberry Pi](https://ai.google.dev/edge/litert/microcontrollers/python) and [STM32](https://www.st.com/content/dam/AME/2020/sensors-embedded-tech-ve-2020/mdg-demo/STM32CubeAI_product_overview.pdf), [TensorFlow Lite for Microcontrollers](https://www.tensorflow.org/lite/microcontrollers) and [Edge Impulse](https://www.edgeimpulse.com/).

* (open to suggestions) Running IoT sensors with cloud analytics, e.g. [AWS IoT](https://aws.amazon.com/iot/), [Azure IoT](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/solutions/iot) or [Google IoT](https://cloud.google.com/architecture/connected-devices/iot-platform-product-architecture).

##### Research projects (Signal processing, machine learning and sensors)

* Galvanic skin response (GSR) analysis (co-supervised with Dr. [Nir Trabelsi](https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=2807768889257381&id=145856082115355&set=a.145856878781942) from Mechanical Engineering Department). An example of a GSR equipment is [here](https://shimmersensing.com/product/shimmer3-gsr-unit/).

* Water flow analysis in pipes (co-supervised with Dr. [Lev Nelik](https://www.pumpsandsystems.com/author/lev-nelik) from Civil Engineering Department).

* Droplet analysis - the follow-up project of the [ML course competition](https://www.kaggle.com/t/6969e148f04c49de9a54b7c0f16cf8cd)
  (co-supervised with Dr. [Merav Arogeti](https://en.sce.ac.il/faculty/merav_arogeti) from Mechanical Engineering Department).
