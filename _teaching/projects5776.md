##### Research projects (Signal processing, machine learning and sensors)
The following projects are mostly recommended for students who are interested in continuing toward an M.Sc. studies (thesis track).

* [Ballistocardiography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ballistocardiography) (BCG) 
  * Field of bio-medical signal processing
  * BCG equipment is commonly used to measure the mechanical activity of the heart, which changes with blood flow, often used in heart rate detection, and more.

* ECG analysis, co-supervised with Dr. Tom Trigano (Ashdod)
  * Field of bio-medical signal processing
  * ECG equipment is commonly used to measure the electrical activity of the heart, which changes with heart rate, often used in heart rate detection, and more.

* Galvanic skin response (GSR) analysis, co-supervised with Dr. [Nir Trabelsi](https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=2807768889257381&id=145856082115355&set=a.145856878781942) from Mechanical Engineering Department.
  * Bio-medical signal processing
  * An example of a GSR equipment is [Shimmer3 GSR](https://shimmersensing.com/product/shimmer3-gsr-unit/)
  * GSR equipment is commonly used to measure the electrical conductance of the skin, which changes with sweat gland activity, often used in stress detection, emotional response research, and more.

* Droplet analysis - the follow-up project,  co-supervised with Dr. [Merav Arogeti](https://en.sce.ac.il/faculty/merav_arogeti) from Mechanical Engineering Department.
  * The goal of the project is to develop a system that can analyze droplets using acoustic microphone, underwater microphone and ultrafast camera.
