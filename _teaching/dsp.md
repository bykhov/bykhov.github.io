Course [Lecture Notes](https://bykhov.github.io/dsp/DSP_Book.pdf) (in Hebrew), co-authored with [Tom Trigano](https://en.sce.ac.il/faculty/tom).

During some of the years, it was a project-oriented course with projects like:
* Distinguish between switch-mode and linear load. A split-core current transformer  [(ECS1030-L72)](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/11005) was used as a sensor connected to the microphone port.
* Average step frequency by mobile phone sensors recording with mobile Matlab application.
* Pendulum frequency analysis by mobile phone sensors recording with mobile Matlab application.
